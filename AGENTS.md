# Repository Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

> **Single source of truth:** This file is a concise pointer document.
> All authoritative architecture, coding rules, and conventions

> Use `Makefile`, `package.json`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as the

## Quick Reference

### Architecture

Go backend + monorepo frontend (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo) with shared packages.

- `server/` - Go backend (Chi router, sqlc, gorilla/websocket)
- `apps/web/` - Next.js frontend (App Router)
- `apps/desktop/` - Electron desktop app
- `packages/core/` - Headless business logic (Zustand stores, React Query hooks, API client)
- `packages/ui/` - Atomic UI components (shadcn/Base UI, zero business logic)
- `packages/views/` - Shared business pages/components
- `packages/tsconfig/` - Shared TypeScript config

### State Management (critical)

- **React Query** owns all server state (issues, members, agents, inbox, workspace list)
- **Zustand** owns client/view state (view filters, drafts, modals, desktop tab state); current workspace identity is route-driven and only mirrored for platform plumbing
- All Zustand stores live in `packages/core/` - never in `packages/views/` or app directories
- WS events update React Query for server data; store writes are only for clearing client-owned pointers with a single responder/self-event guard

### Package Boundaries (hard rules)

- `packages/core/` - zero react-dom, zero localStorage, zero process.env
- `packages/ui/` - zero `@multica/core` imports
- `packages/views/` - zero `next/*`, zero `react-router-dom`, use `NavigationAdapter` for routing
- `apps/web/platform/` - only place for Next.js APIs

### Database Migrations (hard rules)

- Never add database foreign keys or cascading actions. Enforce relationships and perform dependent cleanup explicitly in the application layer, using transactions when the operation must be atomic.
- Every index created by a migration, including unique indexes and indexes on new tables, must use `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX CONCURRENTLY`. Keep each concurrent index build in its own single-statement migration file.

### Shipping work (hard rule)

This is a **fork**, not the upstream repository. When work here is done, **commit and push it directly — do not open a pull request.** Push to the branch the work belongs on; for the webhook-runtime line that is `feature/webhook-runtime-v044`, which is the branch the deployed `backend:fork-webhook` image is built from.

Pull requests are the convention in `dev-command-center`, not here. A fork PR adds a review surface nobody reads and delays the only step that actually ships a change, which is rebuilding the image and redeploying dev then prod by hand.

Two things that follow from pushing straight to a shared deploy branch:

- **Re-check the base immediately before pushing.** It moves. Run `git fetch` and diff against the remote branch, not against the commit you branched from — a stale base makes your push silently revert whatever landed while you worked.
- **Verify before you push, not after.** There is no PR gate, so the push *is* the merge.

### Commands

```bash
make dev              # Auto-setup + start everything
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check
pnpm test             # TS unit tests (Vitest)
make test             # Go tests
make check            # Full verification pipeline
```
